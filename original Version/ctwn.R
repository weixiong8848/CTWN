### AgMIP Regional Integrated Assessments: CTWN Sensitivity Analysis ##

# This routine is structured to produce line plots and boxplots related to a linear factor analysis, intended to explore crop, crop model, and site-specific sensitivities to chnages in carbon dioxide concentration, temperature, water/precipitation, and nitrogen applications. The routine should and can be used by all RRTs in their sensitivity investigations, particularly related to Phase 2 of the DFID-funded regional integrated assessments
